# Currency Converter

This is a currency converter which fetches data daily from an external [API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). The data is fetched from the API daily and cached in the server so that a fast static page is shown to the user. The page is updated automatically using Next.js's Incremental Static Regeneration feature. React and React-bootstrap are used to build the rest of the website.
