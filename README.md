# Currency Converter

This is a currency converter which fetches data daily from an external [API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). The page is pre-rendered at build time and a cached static page is shown to visitors. The cache is purged daily and a new page is generated using the new data. This is done because the external API itself only updates daily (using the free tier anyway).
